# Agent Space

**Agent Space** is a user-friendly AI agent management platform designed for non-technical users. It enables anyone to create, manage, and interact with AI agents using plain language—no coding or complex configuration required. At the heart of the platform is **AGENTA**, your smart assistant who orchestrates all agent activity, delegating tasks and streamlining your workflow.

## 🚀 Features

- **Conversational Agent Creation:**  
  Easily create new, specialized AI agents just by chatting with AGENTA. Define their skills, personalities, and tasks using simple prompts.

- **Orchestration & Delegation:**  
  AGENTA serves as your main interface—think of AGENTA as a delegator who manages agents (“workers”) and reports results back to you.

- **Dedicated Chat Sections:**  
  Every agent, including AGENTA, has its own chat window for focused conversations and task management.

- **Intuitive Agent Management:**  
  Effortlessly update agent behaviors and skills. Review, edit, or remove agents through a friendly UI.

- **Task Tracking & Status Updates:**  
  Track task progress using color-coded status chips (Pending, In Progress, Success, Failed, etc.), inspired by modern UI design.

- **Groq SDK Model Integration:**  
  Choose from multiple AI models via an easy-to-use interface, powered by the Groq SDK.

## 🖌️ Design Philosophy

Agent Space uses a **minimalist, modern, and approachable design**:

- **Rounded Cards & Soft Gradients:** Key components are organized in rounded cards with soft pastel gradients and subtle drop shadows.
- **Clean Layouts:** Plenty of white space, clear separation between elements, and a focus on simplicity.
- **Conversational UI:** All actions are driven through chat and intuitive prompts, making the experience natural and accessible.
- **Microinteractions:** Smooth animations, informative tooltips, and motivational notifications to guide and delight users.
- **Status Chips:** Consistent, colorful status tags for instant feedback on tasks and agent states.
- **Accessibility:** High contrast, readable fonts, and touch-friendly controls.

*Visual inspiration comes from modern productivity tools and the reference UI examples included in this repository.*
